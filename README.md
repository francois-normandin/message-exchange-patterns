# Message exchange patterns and tools for distributed systems

Distributed Systems are ubiquitous, whether for managing communication between multiple processors or harnessing the power of IoT.  We will explore some of the paradigms and tools available to the LabVIEW developer for handling messaging in distributed systems. We review common message exchange patterns and provide examples with MQTT and ZeroMQ.
